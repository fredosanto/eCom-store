## Description

A course assignment in JS Frameworks at Noroff were the task and main purpose is to apply knowledge of React to build a eCom store. The webpage should consist of the following pages: Hompage, Individual product page, Cart page, Checkout success page, Contact form. This assigment only fetches a API assigned by Noroff and doesn't include any HTTP methods.

This is my first React app and I chose to use Vite + React to build the page instead of create-react-app. The whole page is styled with Tailwind for the most part, and react-hook-form combined with yup to build the contact form w/validation. Finally I was tasked to deploy the project using Netlify.
